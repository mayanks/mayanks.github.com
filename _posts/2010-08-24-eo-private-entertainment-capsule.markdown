EO is a unique entertainment capsule which provides a true private home theater experience. You can watch movies or play incredible 3D games in a unique experience. Sachin (my co-brother) has created this and it is live in lower ground floor Mantri Square. Do&nbsp;experience&nbsp;it &nbsp;when you are there and share your thoughts.
