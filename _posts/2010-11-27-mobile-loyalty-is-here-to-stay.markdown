I am becoming a fan of <a href="http://zoomin.com">Zoomin</a>. Every other week they come up with a fab discount on some nice prints. Moreover when you have a 3 year old and a 2 month old kid in the house, you feel like printing photos every other day. I have already got a collage printed, missed the customized mug by a day and now just ordered a flip book for just 99/-. 

But what stuck me, was soon after completing my order I see this on their sidebar.

<br />Notice that they are now taking my mobile number and can link my purchase directly to my number. No more plastic card or 16 digit cryptic loyalty card number to remember. Isn't that awesome? Well yes, that is the reason we started <a href="http://revu.in">Revu</a>
