I join <a href="http://amagi.com">Amagi</a> today. Amagi is a wonderful startup (a second one) by Baskar, Vidhya and Kas. The trio had earlier successfully sold their first startup Impulsesoft to SiRF. I was part of their first startup.

I am quite excited to join my old friends. The company itself is rocking and making a lot of good noise in the startup space. It is doing good business in Indian market and is poised to start offering in International markets. 

My job here will be to create CloudPort product. Using CloudPort, Broadcasters will be able to save on the expensive transmission cost over the satellite by doing it over the cloud.

Here's to an exciting journey with Amagi. Cheers!!
