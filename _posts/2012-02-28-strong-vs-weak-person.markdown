Are you a strong person or a weak person? Strength as in mental strength. A person with strong mental strength is bound to do things which may qualify as <em>success, happiness </em>and<em> contentment.</em>

You are driving on a highway and you see two sign boards. One says <em>This way </em>the other says <em>That way</em>. Which one do you choose? This way. Why? because it is <em>easier</em>. because it is <em>convenient</em>. because I <em>feel</em> like taking it.<em> That way</em><strong style="font-style: italic;"> </strong> by the way is opposite of what I said about This way.

You set an Alarm for 5 AM. Alarm rings, you wake up. You <em>feel</em> like sleeping for 5 more minutes. What do you do? Chose the <em>This way</em> and sleep for 5 minutes (maybe more). You have a meeting at 5PM and at 4:55 PM India is playing the last over of the match and you don't want to miss it. What do you do? Chose the <em>This way.</em>

You are presented with choices every single day, multiple times a day. Every time you chose <em>This way </em>over <em>That way </em>you get into the habit of choosing <em>This way</em>. This habit is what makes you a weak person.

That way on the other hand is the path of <em>commitment, discipline</em> and <em>responsibility</em>. Indeed it is hard to take <em>That </em>way<em>. </em>But the habit of choosing <em>That way </em>every time you are presented with the choices is what makes you a strong person.

Do you have problems with commitment? Do you want to be a strong person and don't know where to start? It's very simple. Start choosing <em>That way </em>whenever you are presented with choices, and the habit of choosing <em>That way </em>over <em>This way</em> will eventually make you a strong person.

<div>By the way, only strong person can be entrepreneurs :-)
