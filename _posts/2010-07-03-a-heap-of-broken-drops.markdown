Ever since I broke a thermometer when I was about 5 years old and got severely reprimanded for it, I always wanted to break one and play around with mercury drops coagulating and breaking on its own. But the grown up side of me always stopped me from doing it whenever I got hold of a thermometer. Today morning my daughter presented me that opportunity by breaking one. Ofcourse it was her turn to be reprimanded, but after scolding her, both of us got down to play with those little droplets.

I don&#39;t know why I grew up, but I definitely do not want my daughter to grow up.
