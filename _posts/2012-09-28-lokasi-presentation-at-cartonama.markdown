Location is something I am quite passionate about. I have worked for sometime at a GPS semiconductor company and for 2 years I worked at <a href="http://onze.in">ONZE</a> developing and running a SMS direction service. This is the time when we came up with <a href="http://lokasi.latlong.in">Lokasi</a>. A unique, India specefic way of representing location that is understood by everyone.
 
<a href="http://cartonama.com/2012/">Cartonama</a> provided me an opportunity to showcase Lokasi. This was also my second opportunity at public speaking. It apparently went quite well.

Theme of the presentation is inspired by an <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/">amazing blog post</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/holman">@holman</a>.
