<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Grahm's</a> articles never cease to amaze me with their powerful insights. It's because they connect with me at a meta level where I am not able to verbalize my own thoughts. And when I read his essay, it's like that's what I was meaning to say !!

<blockquote>
I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given time. That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're allowed to drift freely.
</blockquote>
from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">Paul Grahm's essay</a>


Our startup <a href="http://www.revu.in">Revu</a> is almost two months old. The first month (June) was very productive and I was amazed at my own speed of getting it up. But since it got <a href="http://www.pluggd.in/reviews-on-mobile-checkins-at-revu-297/">mentioned in pluggd.in</a>, Suddenly the focus shifted from development to a lot of distracting meetings. The meetings by themselves did not take a lot of time, but it shifted the top idea from my mind. Every idle moment I was thinking about these VC meetings and less on product development. And that actually showed on the development.

Thanks to Paul for verbalizing the problem, Now I need to consciously keep right stuff in my mind.
