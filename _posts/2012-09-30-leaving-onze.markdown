Leaving a company is never easy. Particulary when you have nurtured it with your blood and sweat. But sometimes, Time just runs out. Nirvana seems just around the corner, but you realize that personally you cannot survive til then. And so with a heavy heart you call it quits.

I leave <a href="http://onze.in">ONZE</a> today, but will never leave the amazing Sud, Ever optimist Rahul and other folks at ONZE.
