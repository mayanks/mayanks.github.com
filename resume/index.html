								<h2>ONZE Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</h2>
								<h3>Co-Founder and Director of Engineering</h3>
								<h4>Oct 2010-Til Date</h4>
								<p>ONZE's flagship product Latlong provides direction on SMS. It solves multiple challenges such as (a) providing directions which are india specific, (b) packaging it in just the right way for consuming on SMS and (c) Unambiguously determining user intent inspite of spelling mistakes.</p>
								<p>In it's initial form Latlong was a C++ application daemon. Multiple such daemons were being run and incoming SMS requests were handled by a self desgined queue and multiplexed to available daemon. I designed a <b>new architecture</b> using nginx, beanstalkd and Ruby on Rails as frontend and converting C++ daemon to a ruby native library.The new architecture drastically increased the service uptime and reduced the flakiness of the system.</p> 
								<p>I also developed a <b>SaaS solution for Latlong's business customer</b> using which they could track how end consumers are using our platform for locating their nearest stores. They could also use this platform as a Route Guide to their customers.</p>
								<p>I introduced and developed a concept called <b>Latlong 360</b> using which business customers could not only use our service on SMS, but also as a Website plugin (Online Store Locator), Facebook widget (Facebook Store Locator) and a branded mobile application for locating nearest store.</p>
								<p>Developed a location aware form called <b>GeoForm</b>, which could use HTML5 browser location or GeoIP to determine users location and reduce ambiguity in providing location in online lead generation forms.</p>
								<p>Spearheaded ONZE's request to <b>TRAI (Indian Government)</b> in granting Latlong exemption from the draconian NCPR guidelines against unsolicited SMS. This required constant followup with the TRAI advisor and meeting the government officals atleast 3 times in a span of 4 months.</p>

								<h2>Various Startups</h2>
								<h3>Solo Entrepreneur</h3>

								<p>During this phase I experimented with a lot of SMS based solutions which could enhance a consumer experience. Each one of these ideas was created as working MVP. I also signed couple of business customers for pilot. I wore both the Tech hat as well as the business hat in these ventures.</p>

								<ul>
									<li><a href="http://www.smstweet.in">http://www.smstweet.in</a> - Tweet your status by a single SMS to a non-premium mobile number. I created this application on Google app engine and using Smsgupshup to host the virtual number.</li>
									<li><a href="http://www.mcoupons.in">http://www.mcoupons.in</a> - A convenient way to carry any discount coupon or a gift voucher securely on your mobile phone. Redeem it partially or re-gift to someone else.</li>
									<li><a href="http://www.mloyalty.in">http://www.mloyalty.in</a> - Replacing card based loyalty programs to a very simple, no nonsense and flexible mobile loyalty system. Convenient to both businesses as well as consumers.</li>
									<li><a href="http://www.revu.in">http://www.revu.in</a> - Allows a business to let it's customer share their experiences with a simple SMS. The SMS could directly update the users Twitter/Facebook status and help the business get a word of mouth buzz on social media.</li>
